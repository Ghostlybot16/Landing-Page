# **Landing-Page Project**

## Reflection 1: Pre-Project
This project is going to be about creating a landing page strictly using HTML and CSS. The current plan is to use flex-box for the layout of the page. 

This is one of my first solo projects where I create something from scratch. At the moment this is a big task and I will need to break it down into components and work on it individually. As well as get into a habit of making good commits. 

I am hopeful and I have enough knowledge to get this project done properly and I wish to learn and be more comfortable with HTML and CSS.
